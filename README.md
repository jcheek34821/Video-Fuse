# Video-Fuse

This script was written to combine all video within a directory. The reason was to combine all videos that were split into 30 min mp4s from a Canon Camcorder
so the Express Video Chopper can run once rather than multiple times. In addition, this script has helped aid in combining all of the player's videos that were made
using the Express Chopper v2. When referencing the Express Video Chopper script's README.md, all the 0's could be placed in one directory and fused using the Video Fuse
as well as the 1's, 2's and so on.

## Usage
Open the script and you will be prompted a window to select a directory. All mp4s in this directory will be combined into one video and saved as "new_video.mp4" 
inside the directory chosen. Once the directory is chosen, click Go.
